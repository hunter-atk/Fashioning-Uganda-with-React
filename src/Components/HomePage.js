            Welcome! This web archive contains 6000 images of decades' worth of
            magazine and newspaper content published by New Vision Printing &
            Publishing Company Limited (NVPPCL), a multimedia business started
            in March 1986 in Uganda. Dr. Caroline Faria and the Feminist
            Geography Collective at the University of Texas' Department of
            Geography and the Environment use these images as data for their
            work on Dr. Faria's NSF project concerning the beauty and fashion
            industry in Uganda. These images, aquired in Uganda in 2016, have
            been made available on this website to university students and
            faculty for their own research. Feel free to browse the web archive
            for images, or explore the site to learn more about Dr. Faria, her
            research, and UT's Feminist Geography Collective.

                Dr. Faria is a feminist geographer and Assistant Professor in
                the Department of Geography and the Environment at UT Austin.
                Her research brings together critical strands of geographic
                thought to interrogate the past-presents of nationalism,
                cosmopolitanism and neoliberal globalization. She views a
                postcolonial and intersectional lens as imperative, given its
                attentiveness to gender, race, class and sexual logics, their
                roots in and across place, their work producing and transforming
                national, ‘modern’, colonial and cosmopolitan subjects and
                spaces, and the efforts of women and others marginalized by
                these processes to negotiate, rework and resist. Her current
                research, funded by the National Science Foundation, examines
                the political-economies of the beauty industry in the Gulf-East
                African region.
              </p>
              <p>
                Her research and activist work are intertwined. A central
                imperative of her work is to support women and minority
                geographers, and those excited by geographic approaches but who
                may not see a place for themselves in the discipline. This work
                includes; building and sustaining faculty-student and peer-peer
                mentoring networks for undergraduates, graduates and fellow
                faculty; mentoring around research, writing, publication, and
                securing academic positions; and both writing on and practicing
                diverse geographic futures.

                Our collective brings together faculty, graduate and
                undergraduate students from within and beyond Geography
                conducting research on power and place. Our research centers the
                politics of globalization and commodity flows. Our broader
                activist goal is to foster healthy, vibrant, and supportive
                academic spaces for feminist geographic research, to support the
                scholarship of women and minority students, and to connect to
                geographic, scholarly, and activist communities working
                globally.

                We are passionate about feminist geographic thought and
                practice, and keen to make it public! We see this both as vital
                in nuancing debates around complex issues and in attracting
                women and students of color into the discipline of geography. To
                that end, we mix in and complement our academic research and
                publications, with public scholarship and outreach. This has
                included (and with support from the Public Fellows OpEd project)

                Our research centers around the theme of globalization and
                commodity flows related to Dr. Faria's NSF-funded research on
                globalization in the Gulf-East African region. This project
                focuses on the hair and beauty industry connecting East Africa
                and the Gulf, and in particular Uganda and Dubai, UAE. It also
                highlights ways in which global processes are intricately
